Description : Our idea is to create a Web Application for an imaginary Restaurant named “ConFusion” .The “ConFusion” Restaurant as the name suggest serves dishes which is a fusion of Indian and Western traditional food.The idea is to develop a website basically for the customers who are also the users of the website.The customer can create an account and login to the website. They can give their feedbacks to the dishes in the form of comments and ratings .The logged in user/customer can delete comments given to a particular dish if and only if he has added the comment to that dish. Also, the customer can add, view and remove the dishes from their favorite list. The website is open for all but only a user logged in with his credentials,  can make changes based on the functionality provided to them. 

Technology :MERN Stack for developing UI/UX and storing customer accounts credentials.
